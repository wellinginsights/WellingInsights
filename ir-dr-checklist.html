                <li>
                    <strong>Assemble Your Incident Response Team (IRT):</strong> Identify key personnel and assign clear roles.
                    <p class="why">Why? Knowing who does what reduces confusion and speeds up response during a crisis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Define "What is an Incident?":</strong> Establish clear criteria for security incidents and define severity levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).
                    <p class="why">Why? Ensures consistent reporting and appropriate response based on impact.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Establish Communication Protocols:</strong> Determine internal communication methods (secure chat, alternate email) and plan external communication.
                    <p class="why">Why? Maintains control of information and ensures timely, accurate updates.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Secure Essential Tools & Resources:</strong> Ensure tools like IDS (e.g., Suricata) and vulnerability management (e.g., GVM) are ready, with accessible logs.
                    <p class="why">Why? Having tools at hand accelerates detection, analysis, and eradication.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Develop Basic Incident Playbooks:</strong> Create simplified, step-by-step guides for common scenarios (e.g., "Ransomware Containment").
                    <p class="why">Why? Provides quick, actionable guidance when time is critical.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Plan for Evidence Preservation:</strong> Outline steps to collect and preserve digital evidence for forensic analysis (system images, network logs).
                    <p class="why">Why? Crucial for understanding the incident, preventing recurrence, and potential legal action.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identify External Contacts:</strong> List contacts for cybersecurity specialists, legal counsel, and law enforcement (e.g., FBI, local cybercrime unit).
